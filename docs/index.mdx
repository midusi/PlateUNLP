PlateUNLP is a system designed to process images of light spectra (usually noisy), with the goal of extracting and cleaning the relevant information.

From each plate, the information corresponding to each contained spectrum is separated, collecting representative functions calibrated in wavelength, as well as the most relevant metadata (Main-ID, UT, etc.).
