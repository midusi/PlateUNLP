pystellib - Making synthetic spectra from libraries
===================================================

:author: M Fouesneau

full documentation: http://mfouesneau.github.io/pystellibs/

This is a set of tools to compute synthetic spectra from libraries in a simple
way, ideal to integrate in larger projects.

In this package, multiple spectral libraries and atmosphere libraries are
provided with a common usage. This allows any user to transparently switch from
one set of models to another without pain (or combine sets together)


This package handles **units** provided through a frozen version of `pint`
included in this package.
